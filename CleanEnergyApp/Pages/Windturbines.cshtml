<h3>Wind Turbines</h3>

<p>A wind turbine is a device that converts the kinetic energy of wind into electrical energy.</p>
<p>Wind turbines can rotate about either a horizontal or a vertical axis, the former being both older and more common.</p> 
<p>They can also include blades or be bladeless. Household-size vertical designs produce less power and are less common.</p>
<p>Small wind turbines may be used for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences, telecom towers, offshore platforms, </p>
<p>rural schools and clinics, remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid,</p>
<p>or where the grid is unstable. Wind turbines produce electricity at between two and six cents per kilowatt hour, which is one of the </p>
<p>lowest-priced renewable energy sources.The energy harvested from the turbine will offset the installation cost,</p>
<p>as well as provide virtually free energy for years.</p>
